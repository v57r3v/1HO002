2.1.1      Assessment   1 – Mood   boardStudents will submit a   mood   board of their   ideal   vision   of   a   defined   hospitality   space.   Students   will   have   to   define their vision of the space   using elements such   as   colour,   materials, furniture,   and   accessories,   taking   into   consideration   balance,   scale,   rhythm   and   stylistic   choice.

The lecturer   will assign each group a mood board.   The presentation ought to interpret the mood board assigned, and   present   a fully developed   design   pitch for   the specified space.
2.2      Proposed   structure   for   the   Mood   board
Below are a few tips for creating   a   mood   board:
•             Use   1-2 overview images of a space that well   communicates the   stylistic   choice
•             Use 3-4 visuals of specific furniture items   that you would   like   to   use within   the   space
•             Use 3-5 smaller visuals that communicate accessories
•             Note: item importance is   communicated through   visual   hierarchy;   your   largest   images   should代 写1HO002 HOSPITALITY DESIGN IC/C++

•             Use a full colour palette with primary,   secondary   and   accent   colours;   mind   your vocabulary
•             Use 3-4 visuals along with the colour   palette   that   effectively   communicates   main   materials
•             Match the mood board design   to   your   colour   palette/concept
•             Optional: you may choose to develop   a   logo for your   concept to   include
•             Index: each item on the   mood   board ought   to   be   clearly   numbered   and   a   corresponding   index   with   item specification should be included   on   a   secondary   page
